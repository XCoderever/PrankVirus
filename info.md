Hi, I'm Flare!
Firstly, I would like to thank you for reading this, and even looking at this very basic and old repository. This was created back at 2017 when I had absolutelY ZERO experience OR knowledge in coding. This was literally RIPPED OFF a YouTube tutorial. I added my own twist to it by modifying some text (jk, I didn't. I literally ripped it off!). After 3 years, modifying my GitHub account, viewing my repositories, archiving those that are old... I found this piece of 'code', and I thought, why not add a restart command and just add my own twist? So here you go, falsevbs/PrankVirus version 2.0. This fixes some capatalisation issues, typos and a restart command. I really hope you enjoy this terrible piece of script!

# Best effects:

This is best used on Windows computers. I STRONGLY RECOMMEND that for maximised effect, change this script's icon to a computer icon. You can do this by going to Properties and finding the Icon section. (Sorry if I'm not right! I switched to Mac a few months ago and I absolutely forgot!)

So... that's all! Enjoy!

~ Flare
